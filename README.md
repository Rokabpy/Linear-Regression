### Student_Marks :

This "Student_Marks" is problem topic and data set from the Kaggle website, by the user yasserh. I solved this problem with simple linear regression and gradient descent, without relying on scikit-learn. In the final step, I evaluated the results by calculating the error sum of squares (SSE).
